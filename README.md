# declarative-knitting
A project to build knitting patterns using a declarative, fluent API.

This project is at a very early stage, experimenting with styles of pattern writing.  Some features are platform-dependent, and the core features may be subject to major revisions.  Most of the unit tests are demonstrations of functionality, rather than genuine tests.
